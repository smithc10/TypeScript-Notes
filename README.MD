# TypeScript Notes

This repository contains comprehensive notes and code examples from the offical [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) to help me in my journey to learn TypesScript. I do not own these examples and have made modifications only to help me better my understanding of the relevant concepts.

## The Basics

This section covers the installation and setup process for TypeScript. It will guide you through installing TypeScript, setting up a development environment, and running your first TypeScript program.

## Everyday Types

## Basic Syntax

The "Basic Syntax" section focuses on the fundamental building blocks of TypeScript. You will learn about variables, data types, control flow statements, and other essential concepts to write TypeScript code effectively.

## Type System

The "Type System" section explores TypeScript's powerful type system. You will understand how to define and use static types, work with interfaces, unions, and intersections, and leverage type inference to write safer code.

## Functions and Classes

In the "Functions and Classes" section, you will dive into functions, classes, and object-oriented programming in TypeScript. You'll learn how to define and use functions with type annotations, create classes with properties and methods, and explore inheritance and polymorphism.

## Modules and Namespaces

The "Modules and Namespaces" section introduces the concept of modular development in TypeScript. You will discover how to organize your code into reusable and maintainable modules, use import and export statements, and manage dependencies.

## Generics

The "Generics" section delves into generic programming in TypeScript. You will learn how to write flexible and reusable code using generic types and functions, understand type constraints, and apply generics in practical scenarios.

## Decorators

The "Decorators" section explores decorators, a powerful feature in TypeScript. You will learn how to use decorators to modify classes, methods, and properties, enabling you to add additional functionality and metadata to your code.

## Asynchronous Programming

The "Asynchronous Programming" section covers asynchronous programming techniques in TypeScript. You will learn about promises, async/await syntax, handling asynchronous errors, and performing concurrent operations.

## Advanced Topics

The "Advanced Topics" section provides an overview of advanced TypeScript concepts and features. It covers topics such as conditional types, mapped types, type guards, module resolution, and other advanced techniques to enhance your TypeScript skills.
